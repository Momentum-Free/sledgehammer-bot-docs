Sledgehammer is a security bot assistant **free to use** that helps moderators manage their communities easily without having to do repetitive tasks across all the managed servers, including global banning users and a variety of other features.

## 🚩 Features

### [🤖 Anti-bot System](getting-started/antibot.md)

This feature gives all new members a verification that they must complete in order to prove that they are human and gain access to the server. It's used to prevent raids, bot accounts (chat bots posing as real users) and malicious users.

### [🌐 Globalban](commands/globalban-unban.md)

The **global ban** command is on the moderator's scope, meaning the ban will be applied on all servers that the bot is in and where the moderator either has `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions or has a whitelisted role.
