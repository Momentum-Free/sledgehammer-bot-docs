# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation page for Sledgehammer. These docs may not always be fully up-to-date. If you notice something is missing, please inform us on the [**support server**](https://discord.gg/5bTsAPnfje).

Sledgehammer is a security bot assistant that helps moderators manage their communities easily without the struggle to do repetitive tasks across all the managed servers, including global banning users and a variety of other features.

:::info
The **global ban** command is on the moderator's scope, meaning the ban will be applied on all servers that the bot is in and where the moderator either has `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions or has a whitelisted role.
