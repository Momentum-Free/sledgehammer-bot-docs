<!-- Introduction -->

Welcome to the documentation page for Sledgehammer. These docs may not always be fully up-to-date. If you notice something is missing, please inform us on the <strong><a href={siteConfig.customFields.DISCORD_INVITE}>support server</a></strong>.

Sledgehammer is a security bot assistant **free to use** that helps moderators manage their communities easily without having to do repetitive tasks across all the managed servers, including global banning users and a variety of other features.

## 🚩 Features

### [🤖 Anti-bot System](getting-started/antibot.mdx)

This feature gives all new members a verification that they must complete in order to prove that they are human and gain access to the server. It's used to prevent raids, bot accounts (chat bots posing as real users) and malicious users.

### [🎭 Avatarban](commands/avatarban.mdx)

This command is used to ban users that match a certain avatar. (currently unavailable)

### [⛔ Blacklist](commands/blacklist.mdx)

This command is used to take an action on certain types of users based on a list of restrictions.

### [🌐 Globalban](commands/globalban-unban.mdx)

This command is used to globally ban a specific user.

:::info

Both **global** commands are on the moderator's scope, meaning the ban/unban will be applied on all servers that the bot is **in** and where the **moderator** either has `ADMINISTRATOR` or `BAN_MANAGER` permission.

### [✏️ Nameban](commands/nameban.mdx)

This command is used to ban users based on their username allowing to use Regex to have a more accurate filter for the name.

### [🚨 Raidban](commands/raidban.mdx)

This command is used to ban users based on the discord's default join message, selecting a start and a finishing message, you'll be able to select those users (useful for raids).
